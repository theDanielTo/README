### :thought_balloon: Who am I?

Hey there I'm Daniel To and I am a full stack web developer based in Orange County, California.

Creation has always been at my fingertips whether through playing piano pieces, building my own PC, or crafting firepits during camping trips. I enjoy the meticulous work that can reveal insignificant details and bring them to light. After discovering what programming can do, I was hooked with the dazzling new tools that were offered to me and since have been working with these tools to strengthen my creative side.

I am a responsible, organized and self motivated individual who works well in a team environment and also independently. I have several years in the manufacturing industry working with a team to keep the quality of our product the finest it could be.
